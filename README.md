# FSIP Minecraft Bukkit Plugin

 A plugin that allows you to open the server to others without a static IP address


# How it works?

 The plugin uses SSH to forward ports to the server. The SSH server provider is serveo.net
## Commands

#### Open connection (opens automatically when the server is started)

```cmd
    /fsip open
```
console and chat output

#### Get connection

```cmd
    /fsip get
```
console and chat output

#### Close connection

```cmd
    /fsip close
```
console and chat output

## Warning! It is recommended to have only one connection!
